I am using this as an working example to learn R and get proficiency in Data Science
I am visiting on Coursera the Data Science Specialisation ot the John Hopkins University.
So far (January 2017) I have finised succesfully course 1 (Toolbox) and 2 (R Programming)
But starting with course 3 (Getting Data) it feel it necessary to work extensively on own practical examples.
