# PIAAC
## OECD Survey of Adult Skills (http://www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/)  Â 
**PIAAC** = **P**rogramme for the **I**nternational **A**ssessment of **A**dult **C**ompetencies.

I am using the material from the OECD website as an working example to learn R and get proficiency in Data Science. I have already used data from this survey and published an article on ICT skills of Austrians. But all the data gathering and manipulated did my co-authors.  

Currently I am visiting on Coursera the Data Science Specialisation from Johns Hopkins University. So far (January 2017) I have finised successfully course #1 (Data Scientis's Toolbox) and #2 (R Programming). But starting with course 3 (Getting Data) It feel it necessary to work extensively on my own practical examples.
